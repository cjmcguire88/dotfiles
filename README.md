# **config-files**

## *config files for Linux*

*The files herein exist first and foremost as my backups. I've only made them public incase someone may find them useful.*  

This repo is setup to be managed locally by GNU Stow. Highly recommended as it keeps dotfiles centralized and it is much easier to track changes through a single VCS repo. Also no need to manually copy files, you can use `stow <program-name>` and it will symlink all associated files to the corresponding directories.
