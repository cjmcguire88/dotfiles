 * There are different ways to inject scriptlets ("push" vs "pull").
 * This function should decide based on the environment what to use:
 *
 * 1) "Pushing" means the adblocker will listen on "onCommitted" events
 *    and then execute scripts by running the tabs.executeScript API.
 * 2) "Pulling" means the adblocker will inject a content script, which
 *    runs before the page loads (and on the DOM changes), fetches
 *    scriplets from the background and runs them.
 *
 * Note:
 * - the "push" model requires permission to the webNavigation API.
 *   If that is not available, the implementation will fall back to the
 *   "pull" model, which does not have this requirement.
